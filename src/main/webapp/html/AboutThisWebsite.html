This website is not school website. It is created by me (a parent) in the hope that it might be of some help to fellow parents.
On this web site, GEA parents will be able to get (preferably free) used uniforms/textbooks from other parents.
<br><br>


<u>How will buying used uniforms be helpful:</u>
<ol>
<li> I think this year, it will be compulsory to buy all 3 sets of uniforms - green,blue and orange uniforms (along with 3 pants). While we can buy one or two from the vendor, one colour we can buy a used set of uniform from other parents.
<li> Sometimes, a specific size of uniform is not available with vendor, e.g. winter has started and hoody is still not available, we could start using used hoody of another child.
<li> At times, we need extra set of uniform e.g. rainy days when clothes don't dry. 
A set bought here might be used as spare set of uniform.
<li> We keep extra set of clothes in school (say kid has wet uniform hence wears the clothes parents gave school for rest of the day). Instead of casual clothes, we could keep a set of uniform bought here.
</ol>
<br>

<u>How will buying used text books be helpful: 
</u>
<br><br>
(This year most of the textbooks have changed, so getting used textbooks may not be so helpful this year, but maybe next year this option could be helpful)
<ol>
<li> At times, the textbooks are in school and parents need to access them at home. 
Say the new book is in school and used book bought here is at home, parents will be able to take kids revision.
<li> If we all parents, can have a copy of text books at home (preferably free of cost), 
we can request school to keep new textbooks in school itself for most days, thereby reducing bag weight.
<li> We could save money on external exam books (e.g. olympiad, NSTSE books) cost if we buy from here.
<li> If olympiad books are bought through school (instead of shop) Olympiad organizers give books at discounted rates, (say Rs. 80 book we get in school for Rs. 60)
but these books reach us late so till then we could use such books got from this website. 
</ol>
