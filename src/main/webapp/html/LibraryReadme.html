  	GEA Parents Library is a concept where we all GEA parents will be able to exchange the story books that we have. 
  	It is completely free. How does it work:
  	<ul>
  	<li><u><b>Step 1:</b></u> Of all the kids books that may be at home, Parents choose ones they are willing to exchange with other parents. To add those books to library, Use "Add Book" link on left.</li>
  	<li><u><b>Step 2:</b></u> Now other parents will be able to see those books when they click on "Library" link on left.(See image at bottom) 
  	Once a parent decides, he/she would like to take your books home, he/she may contact you and offer you (approx.) same no. of books. If you both are walking parents, you could both meet up to exchange your story books.
  	Or if you stay nearby, you could meet up at a convenient place. Or if your kids are big and can meet in school, they can exchange books (say 1 at a time so bag is not heavy).</li>
  	<li><u><b>Step 3:</b></u> A parent can see books that he added to the library by clicking on "My books" link on left.</li>
  	<li><u><b>Step 4:</b></u> While searching for books, you could click on "Library" to view all books available, or you could click on "Search Book" link to search for only the book you are interested in.</li>
  	<li>Please give me suggesstions on how to improve this library concept by sending me email at gundecha.parents.portal@gmail.com. Below is how the library link will look like:</li>
