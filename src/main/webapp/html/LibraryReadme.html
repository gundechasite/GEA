  	Gea Parents Library is an idea where we all GEA parents will be able to exchange the story books that we have. 
  	It is completely free. How does it work:
  	<ol>
  	<li>Step 1: Parents decide which story books that they have at home, they are willing to exchange with other parents.</li>
  	<li>Step 2: Those story books, parent adds to this site - Use "Add Book" link on left.</li>
  	<li>Step 3: Now other parents will be able to see those books when they click on "Library" link on left. 
  	Once a parent decides, he would like to take your books home, he/she may contact you. If you both are walking parents, you could meet up to exchange your story books.
  	Or if you stay nearby, you could meet up. Or if your kids are big and can meet in school, they can exchange books(say 1 at a time so bag is not heavy).</li>
  	<li>Step 4: A parent can see, books that he added to the library by clicking on "My books" link on left.</li>
  	<li>Step 5: While searching for books, you could click on "Library" to view all books available, or you could click on "Search Book" link to search for only book you are interested in</li>

I stopped working 7.5 years back after my child was born. After so many years, for the first time, I have created this website just as a summer activity for myself 
(So please forgive if its not so good). 
This site is completely free. So just for fun or so as to encourage me, try selling/buying (if you want keep price=free) 
some olympiad/NSTSE book or some uniform item and if you can spare 2 minutes then let me know your very frank feedback about this website.
Thank You.
