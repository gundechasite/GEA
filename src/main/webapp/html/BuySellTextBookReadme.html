  	but try buying/selling (preferably free please) Olympiad/NSTSE books from here)

<u>How will buying used school text books be helpful: </u>
<br><br>
<ol>
<li> At times, the school textbooks are in school and parents need to access them at home. 
Say the new book is in school and used book bought here is at home, parents will be able to take kids revision.
<li> If we all parents, can have a copy of text books at home (preferably free of cost), 
we can request school to keep new textbooks in school itself for most days, thereby reducing bag weight.
<li> We could save money on external exam books (e.g. olympiad, NSTSE books) cost if we buy from here.
<li> If olympiad books are bought through school (instead of shop) Olympiad organizers give books at discounted rates, (say Rs. 80 book we get in school for Rs. 60)
but these books reach us late so till then we could use such books got from this website. And if you are a parent who sets their own tests from the books, then you dont have to buy new olympiad books at all if u have a used book.
