  <u>How will buying used uniforms be helpful:</u>
<ol>
<li> I think this year, it will be compulsory to buy all 3 sets of uniforms - green,blue and orange uniforms (along with 3 pants). While we can buy one or two from the vendor, one colour we can buy a used set of uniform from other parents.
<li> Sometimes, a specific size of uniform is not available with vendor, e.g. winter has started and hoody is still not available, we could start using used hoody of another child.
<li> At times, we need extra set of uniform e.g. rainy days when clothes don't dry. 
A set bought here might be used as spare set of uniform.
<li> We keep extra set of clothes in school (say kid has wet uniform hence wears the clothes parents gave school for rest of the day). Instead of casual clothes, we could keep a set of uniform bought here.
